# Problem Statement

NCars Trading International is a leading company in new car sales and is planning to
expand its business by entering the used car sales and service market. Currently,
used car transactions are largely fragmented, unorganized, and lack transparency,
leading to challenges for both buyers and sellers.

Sellers often struggle to determine the right price for their vehicles, find genuine
buyers, and complete ownership transfer procedures. Buyers face difficulties in
finding trustworthy sellers, verifying vehicle authenticity, comparing prices, and
completing legal documentation.

Additionally, manual processes for car valuation, documentation verification, and
ownership transfer increase operational effort, time, and the risk of errors or fraud.

There is a need for a centralized digital platform that can:
- Connect buyers and sellers of used cars
- Provide transparent and reliable car pricing
- Ensure authenticity of vehicle documentation
- Simplify logistics and ownership transfer processes

NCars Trading International aims to address these challenges by launching a digital
platform that acts as an intermediary, streamlining the end-to-end used car buying
and selling experience.
